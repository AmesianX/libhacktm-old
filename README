libhacktm -- An hobbyist Hierarchical Temporal Memory implementation.

libhacktm is a C library written for fun and to understand internals
of HTMs, based on available information at the time (September 2010)
about FDR-based HTMs.

This is just intended to be a base to experiment with it, it
implements feed-forward only learning and inference.

EDIT: Details about the real FDR-based Numenta algorithm are
available now at http://www.numenta.com/htm-overview/education.php
This library was developed while this information was not available,
so it doesn't follow it strictly.
